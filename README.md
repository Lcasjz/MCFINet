Here, I would like to first express my gratitude to the authors of SwinIR. 

Please follow the operational mode of SwinIR to obtain the dataset, place our code into the archs folder, and finally replace the train.yml and test.yml files in the option folder with the ones we have provided. 

If you have completed the above steps, congratulations, you can now proceed with the code-related operations!
